# Boss Machine - Codecademy project

## General info
For this project I had to create an API to serve information to a 'Boss Machine', a unique management application for today’s most accomplished (evil) entrepreneurs. 

This involved creating routes to manage (CRUD) ‘minions’, ‘million dollar ideas’, and meetings that are continually added to a schedule.
